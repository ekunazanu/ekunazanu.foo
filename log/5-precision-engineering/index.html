Systems with tolerances measured only in micrometres. Precision that defines the difference between life and death. Literally. I am talking about jets, like actual fighter jets.<p>For some context, my college is <em>right</em> next to an national air force station, and this week there was an air show happening. Now of course the government does not want any potential collateral damage and a PR crisis, so they asked my college to shut down for a week. Good for me; I would get a lot of time to work on my ‘database’.<p>Except I did not get that much done.<p>This week went by just as fast as the jets. My dorm is right behind the airbase — all I did was watch the F-35s and Su-57s perform a lot of insane maneuvers. As well as watch other planes fly in formation. The amount of precision required to pull it off — both for the pilots and the engineering team — it felt unreal at times.<p><img alt="doodle of jet planes flying in formation" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/log/formation-flying.avif><p>Anyway, I wrote simple implementations for HLL and CMS in Go yesterday. I ran some very basic tests and the accuracy was pretty much as expected. Now I need to write working implementations to store the distribution sketch the top-k elements as well, and then find a way to connect it to the internet.<p>That’s all. I don’t have much more to write, since I didn’t do much else. The only other remotely productive work I got done was updating my <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://notes.ekunazanu.foo/ target=_blank>notes</a> to now include some basic git and networking stuff. Cya next week.</article></main><footer><a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/more#Terms_of_Use>© 2025</a> <a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/about>ekunazanu</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY 4.0</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/ekunazanu/ekunazanu.foo target=_blank>Source</a></footer>
