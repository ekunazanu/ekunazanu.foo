Remember the goals timeline I set out for myself? That was me at the peak of Mount Stupid. Now, I have hit the valley of despair. Turns out I am dumb and had <em>massively</em> overestimated my capabilities.<p><img alt="an arrow pointing at down but not bottom valley of the Dunning Kruger curve" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/log/dunning-kruger-curve-down.avif><p>Well, long story short I live in a capitalistic country and I need money. For that I need a job. For that I need to have skills. Skills that are visible to employers. And that requires me to have ‘real’ projects which is often some sort of kind of…<p><img alt="doodle of drum roll" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/log/drum-roll.avif><p>A web project.<p>Yes, so this site technically counts too. Except it’s too basic, so I really need to start populating <a href=/lab>lab</a> with some ‘real projects’. Luckily, I did write some content during the last semester — most of them are still drafts — well I completed <a href=/lab/probabilistic-data-structures>one of them</a> this week, and should complete another one by next week. The others are mostly about math and other tech-y topics that I personally care about, but recruiters probably won’t, so I will be finishing those later.<p>So is The Plan™ still on? Well yes, I still want to complete everything I mentioned last time. But I am pushing it back; I need to work on projects and grind LeetCode for now.</article></main><footer><a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/more#Terms_of_Use>© 2025</a> <a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/about>ekunazanu</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY 4.0</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/ekunazanu/ekunazanu.foo target=_blank>Source</a></footer>
