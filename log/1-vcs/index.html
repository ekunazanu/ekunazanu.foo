College feels like a giant waste of time and money; not that I am surprised. But to be completely fair I haven’t been productive myself either. I just wasted an entire year. And two years before that. Also two years before that. I have been slacking for way too long and it’s time to get serious.<p>This is the goal: Speedrun the fundamentals of computer science.<p>First things first, I need a plan. Fortunately I have one. Unfortunately I don’t have enough braincells to pull it off quickly enough. BUT fortunately my braincell count is exactly at the point where I <em>think</em> I can do it — right the top of the Dunning-Kruger curve.<p><img alt="cartoonish representation of a Dunning Kruger curve" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/log/dunning-kruger-curve.avif><h2>The Plan™</h2><p>Okay, so The Plan™ is ridiculously simple: Just study. Okay to be slightly more specific, it includes completing the first three chapters of <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf target=_blank>SICP</a>, and getting comfortable with <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf target=_blank>discrete math</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/ target=_blank>linear algebra</a>. I also want to focus a bit on <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/ target=_blank>DSA</a>. All this hopefully by the end the of this first quarter of this year. And if I have a healthy amount of time left, do some <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf target=_blank>math for CS</a>.<p>If all those links seemed familiar, it is because it’s from <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://teachyourselfcs.com/ target=_blank>teachyourselfcs.com</a>. By the next quarter I am hoping to finish <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://teachyourselfcs.com/#operating-systems target=_blank>operating systems</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://teachyourselfcs.com/#networking target=_blank>networking</a> and a little bit about <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://teachyourselfcs.com/#databases target=_blank>databases</a>. I probably don’t <em>need</em> to learn about compilers too, so it’s pretty far down the list of things I need to get done immediately — but it’s a nice topic I definitely I want to learn more about after graduation.<p><img alt="text that says important followed by an arrow pointing down" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/log/important.avif><p>And now, the most important part of The Plan™ — I know my ADHD brain will try its best to get distracted by the most random of things, so the aim here is to post a log every week about the things I learned to keep me in check. Similar to how tracking expenses make people more deliberate about their spending, hopefully writing these logs will knock some sense into me and make me aware of how much time I waste every week. These will be short summaries; the actual notes will on a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://notes.ekunazanu.foo target=_blank>separate repository</a>.<p>That’s all. See you until next week — if this project still exists by then. If it does, I don’t intend on wasting more than ten minutes writing these. So if anyone is reading this, do not expect any high quality posts at all.<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It’s time to start being productive. And hopefully to find gold. Or a job.</article></main><footer><a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/more#Terms_of_Use>© 2025</a> <a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/about>ekunazanu</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY 4.0</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/ekunazanu/ekunazanu.foo target=_blank>Source</a></footer>
