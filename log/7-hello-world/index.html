I did a little searching, and learnt free tunneling services <em>do</em> exist. So I used Cloudflare tunnel to tunnel all requests to PBMBDB. <a href=/lab/free-speech>It should now be available</a> to everyone on the internet — subject to outages from my ISP.<p>Which also means it’s time. It’s finally time to publish this site on the internet. For future readers (if there are any), who are confused: All this while I’ve been posting to myself, for myself. But now, this site is finally live. Now I will post for myself, but to the public. Does it mean the quality of the posts will increase? Lol no.<p>Also somewhat related, I want to thank <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://macwright.com target=_blank>Tom MacWright</a>. He was very kind to license his website design to me for free :)<h2 id=The_Big_(Motion)_Picture>The Big (Motion) Picture</h2><p>Okay then, time for updates. The first half of the week I spent shooting a movie (sort of), and the latter half I spent admiring a different one (sort of). One of the things I learnt while making a movie is that there’s a strict hierarchy in the movie set and you should not annoy those above you. I learnt it the hard way — I was demoted from cinematographer to a runner pretty quickly after I challenged the director’s vision.<p><img alt="animated doodle of hierarchy in a movie set and showing arrows to denote the demotion from cinematographer to errand boy" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/log/movie-set-hierarchy.avif><p>Regardless, that’s hopefully still considered enough work — for me to pass the class. I really don’t want an F grade in a filmmaking class on a Comp. Sci. degree.<h2>El Psy Kongroo</h2><p>The second half of the week I watched Steins;Gate. It is not a movie, but a one-season anime. And it’s a masterpiece. Writing time travel with consistent logic is already difficult, but Steins;Gate not only does it, but conveys the rules of world effortlessly. Its timeline theory is also surprisingly <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor target=_blank>grounded in real math</a>, at least if you believe that the world is a deterministic chaotic system. The voice acting is outstanding; the pacing and the frame composition is perfect; the characters have depth; the score adds emotion without being too soppy; the muted visuals perfectly capture its dystopian vibes. Everything about it feels perfect.<p><img alt="overly detailed drawing anime" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/log/steins-gate-pin.avif><p>I don’t know; it’s been a long time since I <strong>loved</strong> a show.<p>Anyway, cya next week — I’ll be less of a film buff and talk more tech stuff.</article></main><footer><a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/more#Terms_of_Use>© 2025</a> <a href=https://ekunazanu.foo/about>ekunazanu</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY 4.0</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/ekunazanu/ekunazanu.foo target=_blank>Source</a></footer>
