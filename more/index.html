The main typeface of this site is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://rsms.me/inter/ target=_blank>Inter</a>. The monospace is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/ target=_blank>JetBrains Mono</a> and the serifs are <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.forthehearts.net/playfair2_0/ target=_blank>Playfair Display</a>. The entire site is built using <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.getzola.org/ target=_blank>Zola</a>.<h3 id=Blogroll>Blogroll</h3><p>Most of the content on <a href=/lab>lab</a> is influenced by the content I consume. Not all of them are blogs, but it’s some <em>very</em> good content by some <em>very</em> smart people, I guarantee. Here’s a short list of few of the people and/or their amazing creations:<p>• <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=http://colah.github.io/ target=_blank>Christopher Olah</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.3blue1brown.com/ target=_blank>Grant Sanderson</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://distill.pub/ target=_blank>Distill</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://lcamtuf.substack.com/archive target=_blank>Michał Zalewski</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://ciechanow.ski/archives/ target=_blank>Bartosz Ciechanowski</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://acegikmo.com/ target=_blank>Freya Holmér</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://eater.net/ target=_blank>Ben Eater</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://csvoss.com/ target=_blank>Chelsea Voss</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://ncase.me target=_blank>Nick Casey</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://neal.fun target=_blank>Neal Agarwal</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://aatishb.com/articles/ target=_blank>Aatish Bhatia</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://visxai.io/ target=_blank>VISxAI</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://bost.ocks.org/mike/ target=_blank>Mike Bostock</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://explorabl.es/ target=_blank>Explorables</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/ target=_blank>Google AI Explorables</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://pudding.cool/ target=_blank>The Pudding</a> • <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://100r.co/ target=_blank>100R</a> •<p>I would recommend checking them out.<p><img alt="doodle of a person holding a gun and threatening someone by yelling at them to do it" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/other/doodle-threaten-gun.avif><h2>Legal</h2><p>Most jurisdictions require me to have a legal section. It’s the most boring part on this site, and probably most other sites. I tried to look up how to construct my sentences using fancy technical jargon to be legally compliant, but I couldn’t find anything appropriate. So I’m still not sure of the proper way to do this.<p>However, pretty much all of the “This is advice for legal pages but this is not legal advice” pages suggested I should have these three distinct categories, that outlines how I handle user information (if any at all).<h3 id=-1>Privacy Policy</h3><p>There is no analytics done on this website because I’m already aware of my target demographic, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://anubratbora.com target=_blank>Anubrat</a>. The TLDR is I do not collect your personal information; I simply don’t care enough about you, sorry. This entire subsection is irrelevant. I cannot speak for the platforms hosting this site though.<h3 id=-2>Disclaimer</h3><p>I am not affiliated with any entity. In fact, if my college found out that I write all this trash, I’ll probably get rusticated. I also do not take any responsibility for the damage I may or may not have done to your computer. I think it’s kind of your fault anyway if you decided to follow the advice of a guy who is writing the legal pages of a blog as a joke.<h3 id=-3>Terms of Use</h3><p>The content on this website is licensed under the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank>Creative Commons Attribution License</a>, unless specified otherwise.

Attribution would be nice, but it’s the internet and it’s unrealistic to expect everyone to actually comply. It is always appreciated though.<h2 id=-4>Go Away</h2><p>I’m surprised you clicked on this page in the first place, and decided to read through the legal section. There is a real possibility you might be a nerd. Anyway, I don’t think there is much more to add that is apt for this page. Even if there is, I’ve reached the end of my thinking capacity.<p><img alt="doodle of person shooing off someone away" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/other/doodle-shoo.avif><p>Go on then, go away. Read some <a href=/lab>interesting stuff</a> instead of this boring text.</main>
