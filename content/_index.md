Hi! I am Anchit. I am currently a third year computer science undergraduate student. I like math, movies, progressive rock, and coding. One of them is a lie.

I also like doodling I guess.

## About

Most smart people I know have their own blogs and I want to *appear* smart too, so here we are. No, my real goal is to become a competent coder and write high-quality-ultra-production-grade-hyper-fast-efficient-code within the next six months. The one and only obstacle stopping me from achieving that is my laziness and stupidity. And I found a solution: Just keep track of my laziness and stupidity to be aware of my laziness and stupidity. So here I am — creating a web [log](/log) of my laziness and stupidity.

Just kidding; the *real* real goal was indeed the first one: Trick people into thinking I'm smart.

Anyhow, I also want this site to be *at least* of some use to people other than me. And so there's another section [lab](/lab), where I'll post 'real' content. It simply means that I'll try to put at least *some* effort towards the content. Maybe. No guarantees. These will mostly be topics that I find interesting — boring things like math and data.

There's not much [more](/more) to this site. Or is there?

## Contact

If you want to complain about my lousy writing, point out factual inaccuracies, or send ideas or memes to me: Don't. Okay, maybe do. I'm available at [me@ekunazanu.foo](mailto:me@ekunazanu.foo) and at [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ekunazanu.foo). Will I respond? Good question.

I sign my stuff with a [minisign key](/misc/ekunazanu.pub).
