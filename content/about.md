Hi! I am just another nerd on the internet. I like experimenting with stuff â€” mostly with computers and electronics. I also like math, movies, progressive rock, hiking, and coding for money. One of them is a lie.

I also like doodling I guess.

This site started out as a way to keep weekly [logs](/log) of my ~~laziness~~ Comp. Sci. progress, and other random things I learnt. It still exists for the same reason, but on a more relaxed schedule now, after I found out that there is negative correlation between productivity and pretending-to-be-productive. I also created another section [lab](/lab) to post 'real' content, where put at least some effort towards the content.

But the main reason this site exists is to trick people into thinking I'm smart.

There's not much [more](/more) to this site. Or is there?
