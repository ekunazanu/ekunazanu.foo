Here's stuff that I probably should mention.

## Attribution

The design of this site is based on [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com)'s beautiful, minimal site. The main typeface of this site is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). The monospace is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and the serifs are [Playfair Display](https://www.forthehearts.net/playfair2_0/). The entire site is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

### Blogroll

Most of the content on [lab](/lab) is influenced by the content I consume. Not all of them are blogs, but it's some *very* good content by some *very* smart people, I guarantee. Here's a short list of few of the people and/or their amazing creations:

&bull;&nbsp;[Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/)
&bull;&nbsp;[Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)
&bull;&nbsp;[Distill](https://distill.pub/)

I would recommend checking them out.

## Legal

Most jurisdictions require me to have a legal section. It's the most boring part on this site, and probably most other sites. I tried to look up how to construct my sentences using fancy technical jargon to be legally compliant, but I couldn't find anything appropriate. So I'm still not sure of the proper way to do this.

However, pretty much all of the "This is advice for legal pages but this is not legal advice" pages suggested I should have these three distinct categories, that outlines how I handle user information (if any at all).

### Privacy Policy

There is no analytics done on this website because I'm already aware of my target demographic, [Anubrat](https://anubratbora.me). The TLDR is I do not collect your personal information; I simply don't care enough about you, sorry. This entire subsection is irrelevant. I cannot speak for the platforms hosting this site though.

### Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with any entity. In fact, if my college found out that I write all this trash, I'll probably get rusticated. I also do not take any responsibility for the damage I may or may not have done to your computer. I think it's kind of your fault anyway if you decided to follow the advice of a guy who is writing the legal pages of a blog as a joke.

### Terms of Use

The content on this website is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), unless specified otherwise. The media — the cheap graphics and drawings — on this site are mine and are published under the [same license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), unless specified otherwise. The media on this site that I do not own are subject to their own copyright.

Put another way, you can use the stuff I created anyway you like — just don't sue me. Attribution would be nice, but it's the internet and it's unrealistic to expect everyone to actually comply. It is always appreciated though.

## Go Away

I'm surprised you clicked on this page in the first place, and decided to read through the legal section. There is a real possibility you might be a nerd. Anyway, I don't think there is much more to add that is apt for this page. Even if there is, I've reached the end of my thinking capacity.

Go on then, go away. Read some [interesting stuff](/lab) instead of this boring text.
