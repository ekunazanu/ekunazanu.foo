Did a couple of things that week. Another [lab article](/lab/procedural-music) is up as promised. Other than that, also started experimenting with a 'real' language yesterday â€” Go. Why? You'll see, once I get the entire project up and running. Maybe within the next two weeks? I don't know. We'll see how many obstacles come my way a.k.a how much Go(d) hates me.

I am not ashamed of my puns. Cya next week.
