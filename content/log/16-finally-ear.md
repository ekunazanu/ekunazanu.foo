I am in my final year of college — so I need to start paying my bills and more importantly, start saving for a lambo. It is also currently job season. Add two and two, and it should be pretty clear I **need** to start prepping for interviews.

Yes. After seven months, it's time to finally start what I wanted to finish in the previous six months. The reason for the entire existence of this site — to log my progress of learning computer science. Clearly I have veered off course, but it's time to get back on track. You can expect the [notes site](http://notes.ekunazanu.foo/) to be (slightly) less empty now.

In other news, the [new article](/lab/quantifying-colour) for [#SoME](https://some.3b1b.co/) is finally up. It might look out of place compared to the other black and white [lab](/lab) posts, but it would be weird to write an article about colours, and then not use any colours. Also real people would ~~actually~~ likely be reading it this time, so I tried to make it look polished by adding real world images. Crazy I know. I would say I am kinda proud of it. Certainly more than all the half-assed [log](/log) posts.

There's pretty much it. Cya next week. Or in two weeks. I will probably be switching back to shorter more frequent updates soon — to make me productive again.
