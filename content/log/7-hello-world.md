Just a few hours after writing last week's post, I very soon realized limiting [free speech](/lab/free-speech) to a small subset of people is very ironic. I did a little searching, and learnt free tunneling services *do* exist. So I used Cloudflare tunnel to tunnel all requests to PBMBDB. [It should now be available](/lab/free-speech) to everyone on the internet — subject to outages from my ISP.

Which also means it's time. It's finally time to publish this site on the internet. For future readers (if there are any), who are confused: All this while I've been posting to myself, for myself. But now, this site is finally live. Now I will post for myself, but to the public. Does it mean the quality of the posts will increase? Lol no.

Also somewhat related, I want to thank [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com). He was very kind to license his website design to me for free :)

## The Big (Motion) Picture

Okay then, time for updates. The first half of the week I spent shooting a movie (sort of), and the latter half I spent admiring a different one (sort of). One of the things I learnt while making a movie is that there's a strict hierarchy in the movie set and you should not annoy those above you. I learnt it the hard way — I was demoted from cinematographer to a runner pretty quickly after I challenged the director's vision.

Regardless, that's hopefully still considered enough work — for me to pass the class. I really don't want an F grade in a filmmaking class on a Comp. Sci. degree.

## El Psy Kongroo

The second half of the week I watched Steins;Gate. It is not a movie, but a one-season anime. And it's a masterpiece. Writing time travel with consistent logic is already difficult, but Steins;Gate not only does it, but conveys the rules of world effortlessly. Its timeline theory is also surprisingly [grounded in real math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor), at least if you believe that the world is a deterministic chaotic system. The voice acting is outstanding; the pacing and the frame composition is perfect; the characters have depth; the score adds emotion without being too soppy; the muted visuals perfectly capture its dystopian vibes. Everything about it feels perfect.

I don't know; it's been a long time since I **loved** a show.

Anyway, cya next week — I'll be less of a film buff and talk more tech stuff.
