I spent this entire week ~~building~~ admiring precision engineered systems. Systems with tolerances measured only in micrometres. Precision that defines the difference between life and death. Literally. I am talking about jets, like actual fighter jets.

For some context, my college is *right* next to an national air force station, and this week there was an air show happening. Now of course the government does not want any potential collateral damage and a PR crisis, so they asked my college to shut down for a week. Good for me; I would get a lot of time to work on my 'database'.

Except I did not get that much done.

This week went by just as fast as the jets. My dorm is right behind the airbase — all I did was watch the F-35s and Su-57s perform a lot of insane maneuvers. As well as watch other planes fly in formation. The amount of precision required to pull it off — both for the pilots and the engineering team — it felt unreal at times.

Anyway, I wrote simple implementations for HLL and CMS in Go yesterday. I ran some very basic tests and the accuracy was pretty much as expected. Now I need to write working implementations to store the distribution sketch the top-k elements as well, and then find a way to connect it to the internet.

That's all. I don't have much more to write, since I didn't do much else. The only other remotely productive work I got done was updating my [notes](https://notes.ekunazanu.foo/) to now include some basic git and networking stuff. Cya next week.
