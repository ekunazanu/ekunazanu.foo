The Plan™ is going horribly wrong. Remember the goals timeline I set out for myself? That was me at the peak of Mount Stupid. Now, I have hit the valley of despair. Turns out I am dumb and had *massively* overestimated my capabilities.

Well, long story short I live in a capitalistic country and I need money. For that I need a job. For that I need to have skills. Skills that are visible to employers. And that requires me to have 'real' projects which is often some sort of kind of...

A web project.

Yes, so this site technically counts too. Except it's too basic, so I really need to start populating [lab](/lab) with some 'real projects'. Luckily, I did write some content during the last semester — most of them are still drafts — well I completed [one of them](/lab/probabilistic-data-structures) this week, and should complete another one by next week. The others are mostly about math and other tech-y topics that I personally care about, but recruiters probably won't, so I will be finishing those later.

So is The Plan™ still on? Well yes, I still want to complete everything I mentioned last time. But I am pushing it back; I need to work on projects and grind LeetCode for now.
